# Qt Creator

Qt Creator is a cross-platform, integrated development environment (IDE) for
application developers to create applications for multiple desktop, embedded,
and mobile device platforms.

I have developed a simple calculator and a notepad application to get familiar with the basics of Qt, and will add some more apps in the future.
